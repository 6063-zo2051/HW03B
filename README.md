# HOMEWORK 03 PART B

This code aims to recreate a Yayoi Kusama style artpiece that has more of a random character to it. The goal is to have non-overlapping shapes and avoid stright lines.

## SUMMARY
I started by trying to nest 3 differentr shapes all under the same for loop. It was here that I ran into my initial issue, where only 1 dot showed up in my live screen. I then separated the bunch into 3 for loops for each shape, but I encountered an issue with the randomness of the shapes, as they were bouncing around the screen.
